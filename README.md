# Placement Package Prediction Analysis

This project involves the analysis of placement package predictions using various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The analysis includes two iterations, each with different training and testing splits.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `tkinter` (for GUI), `numpy`

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

2. Run the application

## Usage

1. Load CSV File:
   - Click the "Load CSV File" button to select a CSV file containing the placement data.

2. Run Analysis:
   - After loading the CSV file, click the "Run Analysis" button to perform the analysis using Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Artificial Neural Network.

## GUI Interface

The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to interact with the application easily. It provides buttons to load a CSV file and run the analysis, as well as labels for displaying information and results.

## Results

The results are displayed for each iteration, showing metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared for each machine learning model. The results are visualized using bar plots for easy comparison between Iteration 1 and Iteration 2.
